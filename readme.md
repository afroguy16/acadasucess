<h1>Acada<h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>ACADA is an open source community built with PHP using Laravel, it allows developers share links of helpful videos. It's still in development phase.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>I will break down my approach into these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding the goal of the product/Tech Decision:</strong> I read through the document provided, took a critical look at it, understood the goal of the product, and decided on my approach and technologies to use.</li>
<li><strong>Sketches and Mockup:</strong> I wrote out user stories quickly, and did rough sketches. Then I dived straight into mockups (didn't really do fancy wireframes)</li>
<li><strong>Front End Development:</strong> Armed with the layout and look of acada, I downloaded bootstrap, and worked on the major front end part of acada (didn't complete all front end works before heading to laravel)</li>
<li><strong>Backend and Database:</strong> Started out with laravel 5.4, installed socialite 3.0. Then I converted my html docs into blade.php for laravel views, and transfered assets to laravel folders according, created migrations, models and controllers, and worked on a few login and page linking and routes. Still working on Integrating Socialite and Youtube API. I have currently created two tables, users and videos, will be creating other tables for comments, likes and shares in subsequent releases.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting:</strong> After doing some work on front and back end, I hosted on heroku with it's beautiful CLI app and git features. App is currently hosted but not fully set up.</li>
<li><strong>Version Control:</strong> After hosting on heroku, I dived into git, created an empty repo called acadasuccess. And linked repo with heroku, so when I `git push origin master`, it gets updated on git and heroku :-)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Obstacles</h2>
<p>There were a couple of obstacles. At first when I got this assignment, I was like "no, no, how can I accomplish this". But instantly, I remember my mantra "it is doable", and I sprung into action.</p> 
<ul>
<li>My major obstable was time. I currently have a full time job with a January pill up on my desk, so I leave the office late, spend time on the road home, and by the time I get home, I am usually tired.</li>
<li>Another ugly obstable was internet. Strangly enough, my data expired 21st of this month (January), and there's currently no renewal budget until the end of the month (blame it on Nigeria economy :-D)</li>
<li>Laravel 5.4 bugs with migration and socialite not working fleuntly. (Got a lot of help from materials online and by reading the errors)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessings</h2>
<p>This readme file won't be complete without mentioning the blessings and help I got while building this product, and trust me stackoverflow isn't coming first :-D</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest blessing I got was getting a precise document from Anakle that states clearly what the overall product is expected to be. So a lot of research work have been done already</li>
<li>When I got stuck, I was able to find useful resources by googling and "stackoverflowing" :-D (At least I didn't copy any code)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My epistle is long already, so I am going to make this conclusion brief. I am glad to have to get my hands dirty, a relieve from designing web banners and doing SEO for someone (like me) intending to live and breath building and maintaining technology products. I believe that getting in will give me the push I so much desire to improve daily, because nothing beats working as a coder and developer all day. Thank you.</p>
